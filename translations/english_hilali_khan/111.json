So she did not see him صلى الله عليه وسلم. She said to Abu Bakr: ‘Your companion is saying poetry against me.’ Abu Bakr said: ‘By Allâh he does not say poetry.’ She said: ‘Do you believe that’. Then she left. Abu Bakr said, ‘O Allâh’s Messenger! She did not see you’. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ‘An angel was screening me from her.’\" [This Hadith is quoted in Musnad Abû Ya‘lâ]\nIt is said that if the Verse [(17: 45) The Qur’an] is recited by a real believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) he will be screened from a disbeliever.
