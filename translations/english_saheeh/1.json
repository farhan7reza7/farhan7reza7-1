In Arabic grammar both are intensive forms of \"merciful\" (i.e., extremely merciful) . A complimentary and comprehensive meaning is intended by using both together. Raḥmān is used only to describe Allāh, while raḥeem might be used to describe a person as well. The Prophet (ﷺ) was described in the Qur’ān as raḥeem. Raḥmān is above the human level (i.e., intensely merciful) . Since one usually understands intensity to be something of short duration, Allāh describes Himself also as raḥeem (i.e., continually merciful) . Raḥmān also carries a wider meaning - merciful to all creation. Justice is a part of this mercy. Raḥeem includes the concept of speciality - especially and specifically merciful to the believers. Forgiveness is a part of this mercy. In addition, Raḥmān is adjectival, referring to an attribute of Allāh and is part of His essence. Raḥeem is verbal, indicating what He does: i.e., bestowing and implementing mercy.","lang":"en"},{"name":"1:2","price":"(2) [All] praise is [due] to Allāh, Lord[4] of the worlds -","arabic":"ٱلۡحَمۡدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلۡعَٰلَمِينَ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":2,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"[4]- When referring to Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿālā) , the Arabic term \"rabb\" (translated as \"Lord\") includes all of the following meanings: \"owner, master, ruler, controller, sustainer, provider, guardian and caretaker.\"","lang":"en"},{"name":"1:3","price":"(3) The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,","arabic":"ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":3,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"","lang":"en"},{"name":"1:4","price":"(4) Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.[5]","arabic":"مَٰلِكِ يَوۡمِ ٱلدِّينِ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":4,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"[5]- i.e., repayment and compensation for whatever was earned of good or evil during life on this earth.","lang":"en"},{"name":"1:5","price":"(5) It is You we worship and You we ask for help.","arabic":"إِيَّاكَ نَعۡبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسۡتَعِينُ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":5,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"","lang":"en"},{"name":"1:6","price":"(6) Guide us to the straight path -","arabic":"ٱهۡدِنَا ٱلصِّرَٰطَ ٱلۡمُسۡتَقِيمَ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":6,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"","lang":"en"},{"name":"1:7","price":"(7) The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have earned [Your] anger or of those who are astray.","arabic":"صِرَٰطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنۡعَمۡتَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ غَيۡرِ ٱلۡمَغۡضُوبِ عَلَيۡهِمۡ وَلَا ٱلضَّآلِّينَ","category":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah"],"ayahNumber":7,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"","lang":"en"}],"chapter":["1 (Al-Fatihah)","Al-Fatihah","Surah Al-Fatihah","Chapter Al-Fatihah","Fatihah","Surah Fatihah","Chapter Fatihah","Al Fatihah","Surah Al Fatihah","Chapter Al Fatihah","Surah 1","Chapter 1","The Opening","الفَاتِحَة"]}
